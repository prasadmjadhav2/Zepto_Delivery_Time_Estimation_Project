# 🚚 Zepto Delivery Time Estimation Project: Redefining Last-Mile Delivery with AI 🚚

Thrilled to share my latest machine learning project for **Zepto**, where we leveraged the power of AI to predict delivery times with precision, optimize logistics, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project is a step forward in transforming last-mile delivery operations.

---

## 📊 Project Overview:
- **Objective:** Predict delivery times accurately while considering factors like traffic, weather, and operational constraints.
- **Dataset:** 100,000 records with 23 features including:
  - Delivery distance
  - Order value
  - Traffic conditions
  - Weather
  - Packaging time and more.

---

## 🚀 Key Solutions & Achievements:
### 1. **Delivery Time Prediction:**
- Built a **Random Forest Regressor** achieving:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.26 minutes
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 2.15 minutes
- Optimized features like store location, delivery distance, and packaging time for precise predictions.

### 2. **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- Leveraged **XGBoost** with **GridSearchCV**, achieving:
  - **Best Parameters** for enhanced model performance with an MAE of **1.25 minutes**.

### 3. **Traffic and Weather Impact Analysis:**
- Integrated **real-time traffic and weather conditions** into the model to handle dynamic delivery scenarios effectively.

### 4. **Categorical Data Handling:**
- Applied **one-hot encoding** and mapped categorical variables such as delivery type, customer location, and product category for seamless model integration.

### 5. **Model Deployment:**
- Packaged the final model into a **Pickle (.pkl)** file for real-time prediction capabilities, ensuring scalability across Zepto's operations.

### 6. **Customer Engagement Insights:**
- Enhanced customer satisfaction by reducing uncertainties in delivery time estimates and providing accurate predictions.
